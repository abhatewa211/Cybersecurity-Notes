## 🎯 Purpose of Pre-Engagement

Pre-Engagement is the **preparation and legal foundation** before any testing begins.

It ensures:

- Legal authorization
    
- Clear scope
    
- Aligned expectations
    
- Defined communication
    
- Risk awareness
    
- Proper documentation

## 🧩 The 3 Core Components

1. **Scoping Questionnaire**
    
2. **Pre-Engagement Meeting**
    
3. **Kick-Off Meeting**
    

> Before ALL of these → **NDA must be signed**

---

## 🔐 Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Unilateral|One party keeps confidentiality|
|Bilateral|Both parties keep confidentiality (**most common**)|
|Multilateral|More than two parties (e.g., cooperative networks)|

⚠️ You must verify **who has authority** to hire you.

Authorized roles often include:

- CEO, CTO, CISO, CIO, CSO, CRO
    
- VP/Director of IT or Security
    
- Internal Audit leadership
    

If an unauthorized employee hires you → **you are legally liable**.

## 📄 Required Documents & When They Are Created

|Document|When|
|---|---|
|NDA|After initial contact|
|Scoping Questionnaire|Before pre-engagement meeting|
|Scoping Document|During pre-engagement meeting|
|Proposal / SoW (Contract)|During pre-engagement|
|Rules of Engagement (RoE)|Before kick-off|
|Contractor’s Agreement (physical tests)|Before kick-off|
|Reports|During/after test|

> All documents should be reviewed by a lawyer.

## 📝 Scoping Questionnaire (First Real Input From Client)

This determines **what** you are being hired to do.

Common assessment options:

- Internal / External Pentest
    
- Vulnerability Assessment
    
- Web / Mobile / API testing
    
- Wireless testing
    
- Social Engineering (phishing/vishing)
    
- Physical assessment
    
- Red Team
    
- AD security assessment
    

### Critical Scoping Questions

You must learn:

-  of live hosts / IP ranges
    
-  of domains/subdomains
    
-  of applications & user roles
    
-  of wireless SSIDs
    
-  of phishing targets
    
-  of physical locations
    
- If NAC bypass is required
    
- If testing is black/grey/white box
    
- If testing should be evasive / hybrid / noisy
    

This data determines:

- Resources required
    
- Timeline
    
- Pricing
    
- Skillsets needed
    

All this becomes the **Scoping Document**.

---

## 🤝 Pre-Engagement Meeting (Expectation Alignment)

This is where you:

- Explain the pentest process
    
- Clarify client goals
    
- Review scope line-by-line
    
- Educate inexperienced clients
    
- Prepare inputs for the Contract / SoW
    

### Contract / SoW Checklist Highlights

You define:

- Goals & scope
    
- Testing type & methodology (OSSTMM, OWASP, etc.)
    
- Testing location (internal/external/VPN)
    
- Time windows (business hours vs after hours)
    
- Third-party permissions (AWS, ISPs, cloud)
    
- Evasive testing rules
    
- Risk disclosures
    
- Scope limitations (critical systems to avoid)
    
- Information handling (HIPAA, PCI, etc.)
    
- Communication channels
    
- Reporting expectations
    
- Payment terms
    

> Think: “Serve the steak exactly how the client ordered it.”

## 📜 Rules of Engagement (RoE)

This is the **operational rulebook** for the test.

### RoE Defines

- Exact scope (IPs, domains, URLs)
    
- Testing times
    
- Testing type
    
- Methodologies
    
- Objectives (flags, files, access)
    
- Evidence handling & encryption
    
- Incident handling process
    
- Status meetings
    
- Reporting style
    
- Retesting window
    
- Liability limitations
    
- Signed permission to test
    

If something is **not in RoE → you do NOT test it.**

---

## 🚀 Kick-Off Meeting (Right Before Testing Starts)

Participants:

- Client: Audit, IT, Security, Dev, Risk teams
    
- Pentest team: Lead, testers, PM, sometimes sales
    

You explain:

- How testing will happen
    
- That DoS is usually excluded
    
- What happens if critical vuln is found
    
- That logs/alerts/lockouts may occur
    
- That they must contact you if issues arise
    

### Critical Vulnerability Protocol

For example: unauthenticated RCE, SQLi exposing data

You:

1. Pause testing
    
2. Send emergency notification
    
3. Let client assess risk
    
4. Resume when cleared
    

---

## 🧍 Physical Assessments → Contractor’s Agreement

If physical/social engineering is involved:

You need a **separate legal document** including:

- Physical addresses
    
- Floors, rooms, components
    
- Notarization
    
- Explicit permission
    

This is literally your **“get out of jail free”** document if police are called.

---

## ⚙️ Setting Up (After All Paperwork)

Only now do you:

- Prepare VMs/VPS
    
- Configure tools
    
- Prepare payloads
    
- Plan for scenarios
    

You still don’t know what you’ll find — but you prepare for anything.

---

## 🧠 Key Professional Lessons

- Most legal risk is in this phase, not exploitation
    
- Scope mistakes = legal violations
    
- Clients often don’t know what they want → you must guide them
    
- Documentation protects both sides
    
- RoE is your bible during testing
    

---

## ✅ Outcome of Proper Pre-Engagement

You get:

- Legal safety
    
- Clear objectives
    
- Efficient testing
    
- No misunderstandings
    
- Professional client confidence
    

A weak pre-engagement leads to:

- Scope creep
    
- Client dissatisfaction
    
- Legal exposure
    
- Chaotic testing
    

---

## 🏁 Summary

Pre-Engagement is not paperwork.

It is the **foundation that makes a penetration test legitimate, safe, and successful**.
