## ⚖️ Why Laws Matter for Pentesters

Penetration testing **looks like hacking** from a legal perspective.

The **only** thing separating you from a criminal offense is:

> ✅ **Explicit written authorization** + staying **strictly in scope**

Many countries criminalize:

- Unauthorized access to systems
    
- Interception of communications
    
- Mishandling personal/health/children’s data
    
- Circumventing copyright protections
    

Failure to comply can result in:

- Civil penalties (fines, lawsuits)
    
- Criminal charges
    
- Loss of career
