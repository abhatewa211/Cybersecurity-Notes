## 🎯 Purpose of Post-Exploitation

You are already on a system. Now you:

- Gather sensitive information (local perspective)
    
- Understand the host’s role in the business/network
    
- Escalate privileges
    
- Establish persistence
    
- (Sometimes) simulate data exfiltration
    
- Prepare inputs for lateral movement
    
- Evaluate/trigger detections (evasive strategy)
    

This phase blends:

| Component                | Why it matters           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Evasive Testing          | Avoid/measure detection  |
| Information Gathering    | Re-enumerate from inside |
| Pillaging                | Harvest valuable data    |
| Vulnerability Assessment | Reassess from local view |
| Privilege Escalation     | Unlock higher access     |
| Persistence              | Keep your foothold       |
| Data Exfiltration        | Demonstrate impact       |

## 🕵️ Evasive Testing (From Inside the Host)

Being inside makes stealth **harder**:

- EDR watches commands like `whoami`, `net user`
    
- Accounts can be disabled
    
- Hosts can be quarantined
    
- Threat hunting may start
    

This is **not always bad**. If you’re detected:

- You still provide value (show detections work)
    
- You document the full attack chain
    
- You identify monitoring gaps
    

### Evasion Modes

| Mode        | Meaning                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Evasive     | Try to remain undetected              |
| Hybrid      | Test specific detections deliberately |
| Non-Evasive | Be noisy for depth of findings        |

You may combine all three depending on client goals.

## 🔁 Information Gathering (Again, But Internally)

You are now in a **new environment**.

Start Information Gathering again from the local view:

- Local network discovery
    
- Internal services (DB, printers, hypervisors)
    
- Shares and employee data locations
    
- Trust relationships
    
- Local configs and policies
    

This is far richer than external recon.

## 💰 Pillaging (Critical Activity)

Pillaging = examining the **role of this host** and extracting value.

You analyze:

- Interfaces, routes, DNS, ARP
    
- Subnets, VPNs, shares
    
- Running services
    
- Network traffic patterns
    

You look for:

- Credentials in files/scripts
    
- SSH keys, tokens, configs
    
- Password policies
    
- Documents (Excel/Word/txt/email)
    
- Admin activity traces
    

### Why Pillaging Matters

- Shows business impact
    
- Reveals lateral movement paths
    
- Provides credentials
    
- Reveals network structure
    

---

## 🔒 Persistence (Early Priority)

Before going deep, ensure you can come back.

Why early?

- Exploit path may not work twice
    
- Service may crash or be patched
    
- Session may drop
    

Persistence methods vary by system. Be flexible and subtle.

## 🧪 Vulnerability Assessment (From Inside)

Re-run the thinking process using local data:

- Installed software
    
- Local misconfigurations
    
- Trust relationships
    
- Cached/stored credentials
    

Now you plan **Privilege Escalation** safely.

---

## ⬆️ Privilege Escalation

Goal: Highest privileges possible

- **Linux** → root
    
- **Windows** → SYSTEM / Local Admin / Domain Admin
    

Important insight:

> Privilege escalation does not have to be local.

If you find higher-priv creds and log in as that user → that is privilege escalation.

High privilege unlocks:

- Free movement
    
- Access to more hosts
    
- Domain-wide impact
    

---

## 📤 Data Exfiltration (Often Simulated)

Sometimes clients want proof that data can leave the network.

Be careful:

- Check with client/manager first
    
- Prefer **fake/bogus data** for testing DLP/EDR
    
- Capture strong evidence (screenshots/screen recording)
    

Show:

- Hostname, IP, username
    
- Path to data
    
- Successful transfer
    

If real sensitive data is found → notify client immediately.

### Common Regulations Clients Care About

| Data Type    | Regulation |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Credit cards | PCI-DSS    |
| Health data  | HIPAA      |
| Banking data | GLBA       |
| Gov data     | FISMA      |

### Frameworks You May Hear About

NIST, CIS, ISO, PCI-DSS, GDPR, COBIT, FedRAMP, ITAR, AICPA, NERC CIP

What matters to you: **handling controls**, not the labels.

## 🧠 Key Professional Mindset

- You are mapping the network from the inside
    
- You are demonstrating impact safely
    
- You are collecting inputs for lateral movement
    
- You are balancing stealth vs value
    

---

## ✅ Outcomes of Good Post-Exploitation

You obtain:

- Credentials
    
- Network map
    
- Privilege paths
    
- Persistence
    
- Evidence of impact
    
- Inputs for lateral movement

## 🏁 Summary

Post-Exploitation is where:

> **Access becomes intelligence, privilege, and business impact.**

You:

- Re-enumerate internally
    
- Pillage intelligently
    
- Establish persistence
    
- Escalate privileges
    
- Optionally simulate exfiltration
    
- Prepare to move laterally
    

This phase feeds directly into **Lateral Movement**, the next critical stage.
