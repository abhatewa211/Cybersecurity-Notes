## Common Terms You Must Master Early in Pentesting

These are foundational concepts you will see **every single day** in labs, HTB machines, and real client environments.

## 🐚 What is a Shell?

A **shell** is a program that lets a user interact with the operating system using commands.

On Linux, this is usually **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell). Other shells include Zsh, Fish, Ksh, Tcsh.

When pentesters say:

> “I got a shell on the box”

They mean:

> They gained command execution access to the target system.

This is the **first major goal** after exploitation.

### Types of Shells (Very Important)

|Shell Type|Description|Who initiates connection?|
|---|---|---|
|**Reverse Shell**|Target connects back to attacker|Target → You|
|**Bind Shell**|Target opens port, attacker connects|You → Target|
|**Web Shell**|Commands executed through browser|Browser → Target|

⚠️ This concept is fundamental to exploitation and privilege escalation.

## 🚪 What is a Port?

A **port** is like a **door or window** into a system.

- Ports are software endpoints for communication
    
- Each service runs on a port
    
- If a port is open → a service is listening → potential attack surface
    

There are **65,535 TCP** and **65,535 UDP** ports.

### TCP vs UDP (You must know this)

|Protocol|Type|Key Trait|Example Use|
|---|---|---|---|
|**TCP**|Connection-oriented|Reliable, handshake|Web, SSH, RDP|
|**UDP**|Connectionless|Fast, no guarantee|DNS, SNMP, VoIP|

## 🔢 Ports You Must Memorize (Non-Negotiable)

These should become instant recognition:

|Port|Service|
|---|---|
|21|FTP|
|22|SSH|
|23|Telnet|
|25|SMTP|
|80|HTTP|
|443|HTTPS|
|445|SMB|
|3389|RDP|
|389|LDAP|
|161|SNMP|
|88|Kerberos|

When you see these in Nmap, you should **instantly know what you’re dealing with**.

## 🌍 What is a Web Server?

A **web server** handles HTTP/HTTPS requests from browsers and serves web applications.

Common web servers you’ll see:

- **Apache HTTP Server**
    
- **Nginx**
    
- **Microsoft IIS**

Web servers are **high-value targets** because:

- They face the internet
    
- They interact with users
    
- They often connect to databases and internal systems
    
- They have a large attack surface

## 🛡️ OWASP Top 10 (Extremely Important)

Maintained by **OWASP**.

This is the **baseline** for web application security testing.

|#|Category|Key Idea|
|---|---|---|
|1|Broken Access Control|Users access what they shouldn’t|
|2|Cryptographic Failures|Sensitive data exposure|
|3|Injection|SQL, Command, LDAP injection|
|4|Insecure Design|Built without security thinking|
|5|Security Misconfiguration|Default creds, verbose errors|
|6|Vulnerable Components|Outdated libraries|
|7|Auth Failures|Weak login/session handling|
|8|Integrity Failures|Untrusted plugins/CDNs|
|9|Logging Failures|Breaches go undetected|
|10|SSRF|Server forced to make internal requests|

You will see these categories constantly in:

- HTB boxes
    
- Web pentests
    
- Bug bounties
    
- Real client reports

## 🧠 Why These Terms Matter

When you run an Nmap scan and see:

```
22/tcp open ssh
80/tcp open http
445/tcp open smb
```

Your brain should instantly think:

- SSH → credentials/bruteforce/key reuse
    
- HTTP → web vulnerabilities / OWASP Top 10
    
- SMB → file shares, NTLM, lateral movement
    

That instant recognition is what separates beginners from professionals.

## 🏁 Key Takeaways to Memorize

- “Getting a shell” = command execution on target
    
- Reverse shell vs Bind shell difference
    
- TCP vs UDP difference
    
- Memorize core ports and services
    
- Web servers = major attack surface
    
- OWASP Top 10 = foundation of web testing
    

These are **core mental models** you will use in every single assessment.
