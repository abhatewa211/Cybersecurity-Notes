# Web Enumeration – Detailed Notes

## Overview

- Web servers commonly run on **ports 80 (HTTP)** and **443 (HTTPS)**
    
- Web servers host **web applications**, often more than one
    
- Web applications provide:
    
    - A **large attack surface**
        
    - **High-value targets** during penetration tests
        
- Proper web enumeration is **critical**, especially when:
    
    - Few services are exposed
        
    - Exposed services are patched
        

---

## Gobuster

- After discovering a web application, always check for:
    
    - Hidden files
        
    - Hidden directories
        
- These may expose:
    
    - Sensitive data
        
    - Hidden functionality
        
    - Admin panels
        
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
        
- Tools commonly used:
    
    - `ffuf`
        
    - `gobuster`
        

---

## Directory / File Enumeration

- **Gobuster** supports:
    
    - DNS brute-forcing
        
    - Virtual host enumeration
        
    - Directory brute-forcing
        
    - AWS S3 bucket enumeration
        
- For this module, focus is on **directory and file brute-forcing**
    
- Mode used: `dir`
    

### Command Used

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

### Output

```plain
/.hta (Status: 403)
/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/index.php (Status: 200)
/server-status (Status: 403)
/wordpress (Status: 301)
```

---

## HTTP Status Codes (Important)

- **200** – Request successful
    
- **403** – Forbidden
    
- **301** – Redirect (not a failure)
    
- Status code reference link mentioned
    
- Covered in depth in:
    
    - Web Requests Academy Module
        

---

## WordPress Discovery

- `/wordpress` identified
    
- WordPress:
    
    - Most commonly used CMS
        
    - Enormous attack surface
        
- Visiting:
    
    - `http://10.10.10.121/wordpress`
        
- Result:
    
    - WordPress is still in **setup mode**
        
    - Leads to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

---

## DNS Subdomain Enumeration

- Important resources may exist on **subdomains**
    
- Examples:
    
    - Admin panels
        
    - Internal apps
        
- Gobuster DNS mode used
    

---

## Installing SecLists

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
```

or

```bash
sudo apt install seclists -y
```

---

## DNS Enumeration Command

```bash
gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt
```

### Results

```
blog.inlanefreight.com
customer.inlanefreight.com
my.inlanefreight.com
ns1.inlanefreight.com
ns2.inlanefreight.com
ns3.inlanefreight.com
```

- These subdomains should be examined further

## Web Enumeration Tips

---

### Banner Grabbing / Web Server Headers

- Web server headers can reveal:
    
    - Application framework
        
    - Authentication options
        
    - Security misconfigurations
        
- Tool used: `curl`
    

#### Command

```bash
curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com
```

#### Output

```
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
```

- Reveals WordPress REST API endpoint
    

---

## EyeWitness

- Used for:
    
    - Taking screenshots
        
    - Fingerprinting web apps
        
    - Identifying default credentials
        

---

## WhatWeb

- Extracts:
    
    - Web server versions
        
    - Frameworks
        
    - Applications
        
- Helps identify technologies and vulnerabilities
    

### Single Target

```bash
whatweb 10.10.10.121
```

### Output

```Plain Text
Apache[2.4.41]
PHP[7.4.3]
Title[PHP 7.4.3 - phpinfo()]
```

---

### Network-Wide Scan

```bash
whatweb --no-errors 10.10.10.0/24
```

- Enumerates multiple hosts simultaneously
    

---

## SSL/TLS Certificates

- HTTPS certificates may reveal:
    
    - Company name
        
    - Email address
        
- Potential use:
    
    - Phishing attacks (if in scope)

---

## Robots.txt

- Used by search engines
    
- Can expose:
    
    - Private directories
        
    - Admin pages
        

Example robots.txt content:

```
Disallow: /private
Disallow: /uploaded_files
```

- Navigating to `/private` reveals:
    
    - HTB admin login page

---

## Source Code Review

- Always inspect page source (`CTRL + U`)
    
- Can reveal:
    
    - Comments
        
    - Credentials
        
    - Hidden parameters
        

Example:

- Developer comment contains **test account credentials**
    
- Can be used to log in

## Key Takeaways (Do Not Skip)

- Always enumerate web apps thoroughly
    
- Directory brute-forcing is essential
    
- Subdomains often hide critical functionality
    
- Headers, certificates, robots.txt, and source code leak data
    
- Web enumeration frequently leads to **initial foothold**
