## Basic Tools Every Pentester Must Master

Tools like **SSH, Netcat, Tmux, and Vim** are not “hacking tools” by design — but they are **used every single day** during real penetration tests.

If you are not comfortable with these, everything else becomes slower, harder, and frustrating.

## 🔐 Using **OpenSSH** (SSH)

**SSH (Secure Shell)** runs on **port 22** by default and allows secure remote access to systems.

Why SSH is critical in pentesting:

- Much more stable than reverse shells
    
- Used after getting credentials or private keys
    
- Used as a **jump host** for pivoting
    
- Used for port forwarding/tunneling
    
- Used for file transfers
    
- Used for persistence (adding our public key)
    

### Basic SSH Login

```bash
ss ssh Bob@10.10.10.10
```

You will do this hundreds of times in HTB and real assessments.

### Why SSH is gold after exploitation

If you obtain:

- Cleartext credentials
    
- An SSH private key
    
- Ability to write to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
    

You have **reliable, repeatable access**.

## 🌐 Using Netcat (`nc`)

**Netcat** is one of the most powerful and simple networking tools.

You can think of it as:

> “A raw TCP/UDP communicator”

### Banner Grabbing Example

```bash
nc  nc 10.10.10.10 22
```

Output:

```
SS SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-3
```

This tells us:

- SSH is running
    
- Version info (useful for vuln research)
    

This technique is called **Banner Grabbing**.

### What Netcat is used for in pentesting

- Catching reverse shells (listener)
    
- Connecting to bind shells
    
- Banner grabbing
    
- File transfer
    
- Talking to services manually

## 🔁 Using **tmux** (Terminal Multiplexer)

**Tmux** lets you run multiple terminals in one window and switch between them.

This is **extremely important** during:

- Enumeration
    
- Listening for shells
    
- Running scans
    
- Taking notes
    
- Logging sessions
    

Install:

```bash
su sudo apt install tmux -y
```

Start:

```bash
tttmux
```

**Prefix key:** `CTRL + B`

### Most important tmux shortcuts

| Action           | Keys              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| New window       | `CTRL+B` then `C` |
| Split vertical   | `CTRL+B` then `%` |
| Split horizontal | `CTRL+B` then `"` |
| Switch panes     | `CTRL+B` + arrows |
| Switch windows   | `CTRL+B` + number |

⚠️ Many professional pentesters run **entire engagements inside tmux** for logging and organization.

## 📝 Using Vim

**Vim** is often the only editor available on compromised Linux machines.

You must know how to:

- Edit config files
    
- Write scripts
    
- Modify exploits
    
- Read logs
    

Open file:

```bash
vi vim /etc/hosts
```

### Modes in Vim

|Mode|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Normal|Navigate|
|Insert (`i`)|Edit text|
|Command (`:`)|Save/Quit|

### Essential Vim shortcuts

|Command|Action|
|---|---|
|`i`|Insert mode|
|`esc`|Back to normal|
|`dd`|Cut line|
|`yy`|Copy line|
|`p`|Paste|
|`:w`|Save|
|`:q`|Quit|
|`:wq`|Save & quit|
|`:q!`|Quit without saving|

💡 Prefix numbers multiply actions: `4yy` copies 4 lines.

## 🧠 Why These Tools Matter

During a real test, you may:

- Catch a reverse shell with Netcat
    
- Upgrade it using socat
    
- Stabilize your workflow using tmux
    
- Edit files with Vim
    
- Add SSH keys for persistence
    
- Pivot using SSH port forwarding
    

These are **daily-use** tools.

If you hesitate using them, you slow yourself down significantly.

## 🏁 Key Takeaways

- SSH = stable access, pivoting, persistence
    
- Netcat = talk to any port, catch shells, banner grab
    
- Tmux = multitask like a pro, keep sessions organized
    
- Vim = edit anything, anywhere, even on compromised hosts
    

Mastering these is a **force multiplier** for every other skill you learn.

### Steps for getting the answer and Solving the Module.

Step1. Spawn the target system and copy the IP:PORT

Step2. Open the terminal of your parrot distro provided by HTB or use your distro mine Kali Linux.

Step3. Now run the netcat command, grab the banner and submit the banner as answer.
